## Thank you

Thank you for using the theme. If you want to see an example post go [here](posts/2021-1-17-installing-hyvor/). [Download the theme](https://github.com/smolcodes/twentytwenyonetheme)

## Mathjax

To use mathjax, simply put your math between `\\(...\\)` for inline code and between `$$...$$` for free standing code. **IMPORTANT** do not include the back ticks!

`\\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\)` yields \\(z = x + y\\) And ` $$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $$ ` gives.

>$$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $$

## Shortcode

```html
{% raw %}{% Image "Image URL", "Image description" %}{% endraw %}
```
This short code will make your images load faster and is responsive. You can use it in your markdown instead of`[Image Description](image url)`.

##
## Hyvor

You must have a Hyvor account to use this feature. In sr/_includes/layouts open post.njk and look for

```html
<!--- Change  ID number to your Hyvor Website ID. Remove comment line to use Hyvor
<div id="hyvor-talk-view"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    var HYVOR_TALK_WEBSITE = IDNUMBER; // DO NOT CHANGE THIS
    var HYVOR_TALK_CONFIG = {
        url: '{% raw %}{% set absolutePostUrl %}{{ site.url }}{{ post.url | url }}{% endset %}{% endraw %}',
        id: '{% raw %}{{page.id}}{% endraw %}'
    };
</script>
<script async type="text/javascript" src="//talk.hyvor.com/web-api/embed"></script>
-->
```

Delete the comment out code (the <! and ---- and -->). Change `IDNUMBER` to your Website ID from Hyvor.
